## Teaching Assistant Contact Helper (TACH)

* This is a team project for a desktop application (called **TACH**) used by Computer Science (**CS**)
Teaching Assistants (**TA**s) in NUS to manage and keep track of their students and their progress 
on tutorial work/participation.
* **TACH** aims to solve problems of CS TAs regarding management and alleviate their workload by:
  * Giving a clear summary/overview of the students' progress and details
  * Sort a given student's work by their module and class
* It is named `Teaching Assistant Contact Helper` (`TACH` for short) because it helps TAs with their students'
contacts, along with their progress on their tutorials.
* For detailed documentation of this project, see the
**[TACH Product Website](https://ay2122s2-cs2103t-w15-3.github.io/tp/)**
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the
[SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
